                 <h1>What is Cloud Technology?</h1>
                 
                 <p>The term "cloud computing" is everywhere. In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet.</p>

             <h2>Software as a Service(SaaS)</h2>
             
             <p>
              Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. 
              Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providerâ€™s servers.
                Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. 
            SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

                Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
            This helps you be more efficient as you don't need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
